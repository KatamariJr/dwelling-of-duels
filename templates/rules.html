<h1>Rules for Participation</h1>

<div class="hline-r"></div>

<h2>Main Entries</h2>

<div class="hline-r"></div>

<p>
  Main entries are songs entered into the month's competition, which will be
  ranked on the results.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Main entries must be a cover, arrangement, or other reworking of a song
    from a video game.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Unless specified in a particular month's conditions, you can't cover
        songs that were used in video games but written for other media (e.g.
        the iconic Star Wars theme, or the original Michael Jackson songs in
        Moonwalker).

        <ul>
          <li>
            Exception: Tetris, the soundtrack of which uses Russian folk
            music but is much more widely recognizable as video game music.
            Main entries may be reworkings of Tetris songs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Each month has a theme; all songs must fit that theme.</li>

  <li>
    The main instrument of each song must be "played live", meaning that it
    must be a real guitar, real keyboard, real trombone, or other real
    instrument that you're actually playing.

    <ul>
      <li>
        An instrument that is sequenced in a software synthesizer is only
        eligible if a MIDI controller keyboard is played live, and the output
        is not quantized or altered.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Main entries must be submitted in mp3 format, at least two minutes in
    length.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Silence at the beginning or end of a track, or extended silence in
        the middle of a track, will not count toward reaching the length
        requirement.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Main entries will be presented anonymously at the end of the month
    (tagged as "Anonymous DoD Contestant"). Please don't compromise your
    anonymity, and only submit songs that you've never released to the public.
  </li>

  <li>
    All songs must either be submitted by the artist or by someone who has
    permission from the artist, with the following information included:

            will be altered.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Optionally, you may also include the following information:
    <ul>

      <li>Names of the songs from the game's soundtrack.</li>
      <li>
        Locations, stages, or scenarios in the game where the songs are used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Which instruments in the song were played live and which were
        programmed/sequenced.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Songs are due on the due date and time listed on the Main Page in the
    "Submission Deadline" section.
  </li>

  <li>
    You may not be the primary arranger and performer on more than one main
    entry per month.

    <ul>
      <li>
        You may, however, contribute to one main entry by other person, in
        addition to your own song. ("Contribute" meaning play an instrument on
        someone else's song, mix it, do a cameo solo, etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Voting</h2>

<div class="hline-r"></div>

<p>The winner is determined by the biggest score.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Voting is open for everyone.
  </li>

  <li>
    Voting is automated through

    {% if voting %}
      <a href="/voting/">our voting app</a>.
    {% else %}
      our voting app.
    {% endif %}

    You simply score each song from "Incredible" to "Terrible" using the
    sliders.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The app produces a vote based on the placement of the
        slider; for example, if you place the slider between "Average" and
        "Above Average", it may say that you gave the song "Average +0.38." The
        combination of the word score and the numerical adjustment is how the
        votes are tallied and averaged to produce the results.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you entered a song, please check the box next to your entry
        labeled "My Song" when voting.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    After having scoring each song, copy the text in the text field below
    and mail it to <a href="mailto:dodsongs@gmail.com">dodsongs@gmail.com</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    Votes are due by 11:59 PM Eastern US time on the last day of the
    month unless otherwise specified.

<h2>Listening Parties</h2>

<div class="hline-r"></div>

<p>
  Listening parties take place on internet radio
  <a href="http://www.8bitx.com/" title="8BitX">8BitX</a> and use an IRC
  chatroom to allow artists and fans to listen to and discuss the songs in real
  time.
</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    All entries are played on air. You can listen to the broadcast on the on
    the <a href="http://www.8bitx.com/" target="_blank">8bitX
    website</a> or download a playlist to use with a media player of your
    choice.
  </li>

  <li>
    You can join the discussion via the
    <a href="http://www.8bitx.com/chatroom/" target="_blank">web-based chat</a>
    on the 8bitX website. Alternatively, you can join in by getting an IRC
    client and connecting to irc.esper.net and joining #8bitXChat.

    <ul>
      <li>
        There will be a space in the IRC client to enter text:

        <ul>
          <li>
            /nick allows you to choose a username (for example "/nick
            UematsuFan" "/nick Abraham_L").
          </li>

          <li>
            /join allows you to join a channel ("/join #dwellingofduels").
          </li>

          <li>
            Enter plain text without a slash (like this sentence) to talk to
            people.
          </li>

          <li>
            Check your IRC client's help guide for more information.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Listening parties start with the release of the month's songs
    unless otherwise noted.
  </li>

  <li>
    The listening parties (and IRC in general) are pretty casual and often go
    off-topic, but anything disruptive (like "spamming", entering too much text
    too fast) might result in you being removed from the channel. Repeated
    offences may result in you being barred from entry.
  </li>

  <li>
    The IRC channel is open to any sort of discussion, 24/7, even when the
    listening parties or other 8BitX shows are not taking place.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>General Disclaimer</h2>

<div class="hline-r"></div>

<p>Any activity which disrupts the contest, website, forums /
discussions, IRC channel, or any other aspect of Dwelling of Duels may result
in disqualification of your entry, rejection of future entries, rejection of
votes, or other measures. This includes compromising someone else's anonymity
by revealing that they created an entry when this information is not
available publicly.</p>
